# Explanation of SHR data for individual markets

The demographic clearance data comes from the FBI Supplemental Homicide Reports (SHR), which are submitted to the FBI and contain incident-level homicide information. Not all agencies that submit data to the FBI submit SHRs, so the data isn't available for all agencies. In addition, some states, including Florida, don't submit SHR data at all.

These clearance rates can sometimes be higher than the overall clearance rates we previously shared. According to research from the Murder Accountability Project, which studies clearance rates, that's because some agencies report offender data in SHRs even when a case isn't officially cleared. For example, if a witness described an offender but the offender wasn't arrested, some agencies will input that data into the SHRs, which means the case will be considered "cleared" in our analysis.

When looking at this data, you should focus primarily on the differences in clearance rates between demographic groups. For example, the clearance rate for Black victims might be around 50%, whereas the clearance rate for white victims could be much higher. You may also notice that the clearance rates for Black victims has fallen. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, it might be higher than it was in 2019 and 2020. If that's the case for your state or any of the agencies in your data, you'll want to highlight that trend.
