# Data analysis

This folder contains jupyter notebooks with analysis of the outputs of all previous tasks. The files in the output/ directories of each subfolder contain table created in those notebooks, which will be used in subsequent tasks. 

Note that although these are notebooks, not scripts, they're intended to be run from the command line and not interactively. The interactive notebooks are primarily there for sharing purposes.
